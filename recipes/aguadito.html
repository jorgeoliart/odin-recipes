    <h2 class="recipe-steps">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium heat, add the chicken pieces, and sear them. </li>
        <li>Transfer the chicken pieces to a plate and keep warm.</li>
        <li>In the same saucepan sauté onion and garlic until golden.</li>
        <li>Process cilantro leaves and fresh aji amarillo with ¼ cup water in a blender until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add to the onion mixture, along with the chicken stock, beer, if using, chicken, bell pepper, corn, and carrots. Bring to a boil, turn the heat to low, cover with a lid, and simmer for 30 minutes. If you are using chicken breasts, it´s better to add them along with the rice so they don´t overcook.</li>
        <li>Add rice and potatoes. If you have big green peas, add them now. If they are small add them five minutes before turning off the heat.</li>
        <li>Put the lid on and simmer until the potatoes are tender and the rice is cooked. If the soup is too thick, add more stock. Taste for seasoning, and serve.</li>
