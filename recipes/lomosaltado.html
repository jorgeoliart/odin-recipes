        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves finely diced</li>
        <li>1 red onion cut in thick slices</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes cut in thick slices</li>

        <li>Season the sirloin steak with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Put a wok or a pan over very high heat. Add the oil and saute the meat, a few slices at a time so they don't steam but remain golden instead (about 10 minutes, depending on how strong the flame is)</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, onion, tomato, chili pepper, and stir for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce and vinegar in the sides of the pan and mix everything. Season with more salt and pepper.</li>

    </ol>
